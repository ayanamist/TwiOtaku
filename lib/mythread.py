# Read write lock
# ---------------

class ReadWriteLock(object):
    """Read-Write lock class. A read-write lock differs from a standard
    threading.RLock() by allowing multiple threads to simultaneously hold a
    read lock, while allowing only a single thread to hold a write lock at the
    same point of time.

    When a read lock is requested while a write lock is held, the reader
    is blocked; when a write lock is requested while another write lock is
    held or there are read locks, the writer is blocked.

    Writers are always preferred by this implementation: if there are blocked
    threads waiting for a write lock, current readers may request more read
    locks (which they eventually should free, as they starve the waiting
    writers otherwise), but a new thread requesting a read lock will not
    be granted one, and block. This might mean starvation for readers if
    two writer threads interweave their calls to acquireWrite() without
    leaving a window only for readers.

    In case a current reader requests a write lock, this can and will be
    satisfied without giving up the read locks first, but, only one thread
    may perform this kind of lock upgrade, as a deadlock would otherwise
    occur. After the write lock has been granted, the thread will hold a
    full write lock, and not be downgraded after the upgrading call to
    acquireWrite() has been match by a corresponding release().
